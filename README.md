# Basic-Computer
# Basic Computer (M. Morris Mano) - Verilog Implementation
# Project Overview
This project is a Verilog-based hardware implementation of the Basic Computer architecture from the textbook "Digital Design and Computer Architecture" by M. Morris Mano. It faithfully models the datapath, control unit, memory system, and I/O instructions as described in the book, and simulates instruction execution cycle-by-cycle.

# Architecture Features
* 16-bit Word Length

* 12-bit Address Bus (4K words of memory) // this is in mano's basic computer specifications, but in the verilog code for simplicity of the simulation we scaled the size of registers

* internal Registers: AC, DR, IR, TR, AR, PC, INPR, OUTR

* Memory: 4096x16-bit, initialized from external file

* ALU Operations: AND, ADD, LDA, CLA, etc.

* sequence counter: Implements micro-operations T0–T15 // the maximum size for instruction is 15 but this also in mano's specifications and we scale this and reduce it for simplicity

* Instruction Set:

+ Memory-Reference Instructions (AND, ADD, LDA, STA, BUN, etc.)
+ Register-Reference Instructions (CLA, INC, HLT, etc.)
### I/O Instructions (INP, OUT)
\\ I/O regs: 8-bit INPR and OUTR

* it also based on a cructial concept which is the timing and control structure which means that each microoperation has it is corresponding execuation
